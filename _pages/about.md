Pleased to meet you, I'm Jeremy. I'm a hybrid mobile app developer for Security Service Federal Credit Union. I work and reside in Texas, hailing from the
North Texas area. I'm a husband to a wife who is much too good for me, a servant to three rambuctious cats, a videogame and tabletop enthusiast, and at
times even programmer. I love to learn and will always consider myself a student. My faith drives my beliefs in love, community, human rights, and peace.

I went to school for Computer Science first at Midwestern State University (B.S.) and then at University of North Texas (M.S.) where my area of focus
("track") was in Game Programming. I've been programming since I was 11 years old, and it all started with making small game projects. I've been working in
web development since 2017, where I learned much of what I know from a hero of mine, Dr. Terry Griffin (MSU).
