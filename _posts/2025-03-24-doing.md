## Well well

Look who didn't follow up on his plans to start posting, again. I can't say that I'm not disappointed in myself, but all I can do is try "try again". I've been sort of exhausted with life and work for the last few years. Today I felt inspired to *do stuff again*. So, I went back to "Crayon Blaster" (which I said I would finish up 5 months ago as part of some renewed game dev efforts). I want to accomplish the same thing I wanted to then: finish up the game and move on to something else. I don't want to give up on these hobbies that I used to love.

## What did I do today?
I added a difficulty progression to Crayon Blaster. I added a dynamic score that is based on both "kills" and the amount of time you've survived. Both these changes are indicated by the "Threat Level". I added hints that randomly appear on the game over screen. I added meteors coming from different directions over time. I made a little doodle to be "smart" enemies if I decide to do that. If I do, my current thought it to just make them home in on the player, unlike the meteors. That would make these drone enemies something the player has to destroy, rather than ignore.

## At least I did something

And I feel happier than I did yesterday.
